Welcome to my portfolio website! You can access my resume under Images. Check out my games folder too!

Some bugs that need correcting:
- Top-left aligning the dropdown header. It hits an invisible wall for higher resolutions for unkown reasons, my guess is that it is constrained by a parent with margins or padding/margins are added in the responsive CSS. 
- Enable PHP contact form functionality. Not critical at all, but frustrating to identify and correct errors.
